This is an optimised and pheromone simulation
You can adjust the food clumps (they are square because i am lazy)
It is currently bugged (some pheromones cant despawn)
Death spirals are possible, ants unable to get to the food is also possible


This was inspired on youtube by Sebastian League and Pezzzas Work
