# Bootleg-dev
This repository is a collection of simulations and engines based off of real complex and interesting algorithms, created without any research (i call it bootlegging)
Every project in this collection was created at a different time with different skill levels and motivation, most of them are just for learning.

WARNING: the code in some of these is so unbelievably spagetti it could be lethal, you've been warned.
